Machine Reading Comprehension using NLP Techniques for Q&A

The prime objective of this study is to develop a Machine Reading Comprehension system which can help to understand and digest large volume of text from PDF’s or websites and will be capable to answer any question related to the subject. The model will be trained using open data sets from SQUAD and others places. The training set will represent a language understanding model hence more diverse data we provide to train generally better.
